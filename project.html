    <h1>DataBaseD Project Proposal</h1>
    <div>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h4>Description of the application of your choice. State as clearly as possible what
                    you want to do.</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Our application will allow users to visualize and compare the trends of the
                        lowest prices available for a selected video game across several different
                        distribution services. Not only will it plot those price trends, but it will
                        also specify for the user which site had that lowest price</li>
                    <li>Another feature for our application is our video game recommender. For this,
                        the user will be able to select games that they would like the system to
                        base its recommendations off of. Our application will then provide the user
                        with game recommendations that they can either “like” or “dislike”. These
                        responses will be factored into their future recommendations</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Usefulness. State as clearly as possible why your chosen application is useful.
                    Make sure to answer the following questions: Are there any similar or equivalent
                    websites/applications out here? If so, what are they and how are yours
                    different?</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Our application is useful because it not only allows the user to know what
                        site to buy their selected game on, but it also shows them the price trends
                        so they can decide whether or not to delay their purchase. In addition to
                        this it can give them recommendations that they can examine the prices of
                        all on the same site.</li>
                    <li>Some similar sites are gocdkeys.com (redirects user to cheap site for their
                        specified game), dlcompare.com (compares current prices for games and
                        DLC’s), and pricecharting.com (plots game prices for sites one at a
                        time)</li>
                    <li>These similar sites fail to fully satisfy our goals since gocdkeys.com and
                        dlcompare.com do not show past prices and pricecharting.com does not plot
                        the lowest prices between platforms.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Realness. Describe what your data is and where you will get it.</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Our data is the titles of video games, the prices (over time), attribute
                        tags/labels of each video game as offered by the distributors’ APIs and a
                        description of the game. Another table will include data entered by the user
                        which includes video games that they played and a rating of how much they
                        liked it.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Description of the functionality that you plan to offer. This is where you talk
                    about how to meet the functionality requirements. There are two types of
                    functions you need to offer:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>Basic Functions: see Stage 4 for what basic functions you need to
                            offer.</p>
                        <ul>

                                <li>we will scrape prices for the video games daily from
                                        websites to insert and update records. users will be able to
                                        add/delete their account and update the password for that
                                        account. additionally, they will be able to create
                                        likes/dislikes relations between their account and a game
                                        when they like or dislike a game.</li>

                                    results. You need to show a few different interesting queries
                                    over your database. *One of the queries must involve joins of
                                    multiple tables.*</p>

                                <p>Remember to include at least two creative things (advanced
                                    functions), i.e., something that doesn’t exist in equivalent
                                    websites/applications. The advanced functions should go beyond
                                    the basic functions listed above; in addition, an advanced
                                    function should also be something that is technically
                                    challenging, meaning you would need to spend some significant
                                    time (at least a few days work) to implement it.</p>
                            </li>

                                <li>User input for game name will be accepted and whatever option is
                                    enabled (show platform prices or price history) will be queried
                                    from the database. That data will be converted to a visual
                                    format and displayed to the website</li>
                                <li>User input for the game in which the user played and the rating
                                    that they give said game. Other information about the game can
                                    be queried and brought over from the available table of prices
                                    and brought into the user table.</li>

                                <p>Make clear what the features are, and explain why you think it is
                                    cool to have them. If you are unclear, please check the project
                                    overview lecture or talk to TA.</p>

                                <li>Allow a user to search for a game and display the current prices
                                    across all platforms, and allow an option to view price
                                    trends/history for each of the platforms as well</li>
                                <li>Users will have an account where they can input which games they
                                    like, and we will use that data to generate recommendations for
                                    other games that they may like based on shared attributes</li>
